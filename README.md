# lyra-astractus
### Lyra Astractus is a game made by me and Finn based off of the DND campaign of the same name
The design was created between the two of us with all development being done by me,
this is made entirely in C# for the back end, with our MVP being our first solar system
Inkport. Inkport should be an open world, where the user can navigate via a spaceship they
acquire at the beginning of the game.
